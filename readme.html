<h1>A Guide To Thematic</h1>
<p>Thematic is more than just a WordPress theme, it's also a Theme Framework. Now, that doesn't mean it's hard to use, bloated or overcomplicated. Quite the opposite. It's extremely easy to use, lean and well organized.</p>

<h2>Widget-Ready Areas</h2>
<p>Thematic has 13 widget-ready areas, called <em>Asides</em>, that can be used creatively to customize your theme.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Primary Aside</h3>
<p>Located immediately after the content area in the markup. Typically used as a sidebar. By default it contains <em>Search</em>, <em>Pages</em>, <em>Categories</em> and <em>Archives</em> widgets. Use the widgets panel under <code>Design</code> to add your own widgets and override the default.</p></li>
<li><h3>Secondary Aside</h3>
<p>Located immediately after the Primary Aside in the markup. Typically used as a sidebar. By default it contains <em>Links</em>, <em>RSS Feeds</em> and <em>Meta</em> widgets.</p></li>
<li><h3>Subsidiary Asides</h3>
<p>Located in the footer. Empty of widgets by default, they will not apear in the theme markup until you add a widget.</p></li>
<li><h3>Index Asides</h3>
<p>Located in the content area of the index, or blog page. Empty of widgets by default, they will not apear in the theme markup until you add a widget. The location of the <em>Index Insert</em>, which appears between posts, is controlled from the theme options page. The default position sets it to appear after the second post.</p></li>
<li><h3>Single Asides</h3>
<p>Located in the content area of single post pages. Empty of widgets by default, they will not apear in the theme markup until you add a widget.</p></li>
<li><h3>Page Asides</h3>
<p>Located in the content area of static pages. Empty of widgets by default, they will not apear in the theme markup until you add a widget.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Dynamic Contextual Body Classes</h2>
<p>Thematic makes use of the dynamic contextual class functions developed by Scott Wallick and Andy Skelton for <a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/">The Sandbox</a>. These functions make Thematic almost endlessley customizable through <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> alone.</p>
<p>To really see how these classes work, where they appear and how you can use them, I recommend the Firefox extension, <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>.</p>

<h2>Child Themes</h2>        
<p>Thematic has been specially optimized to take advantage of the power of WordPress Child Themes. Unless you plan on making <strong>extreme</strong> modifications I recommend you use a Child Theme to customize Thematic.</p>
<p>I've compiled a few Thematic Child Themes that can help you get started. If you'd like to see your Child Theme listed here, <a href="http://themeshaper.com/contact/">contact Ian Stewart</a>.</p>

<h2>Credit and Inspiration</h2>
<p>Thematic is a fork of the hugely succesful and amazing <a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/">Sandbox theme for WordPress</a> and inherits the bulk of that code base. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Scott Wallick and Andy Skelton, not only for their work on The Sandbox but for their ongoing help with, and support of, my efforts. Thank you Scott and Andy.</p>

<p>In addition, Thematic has been inspired by and uses techinques from the following people and projects.</p>
